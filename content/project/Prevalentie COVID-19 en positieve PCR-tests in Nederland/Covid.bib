abstract = {We point out an example of Simpson's paradox in COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFRs): comparing data from > 72, 000 cases from China with data from Italy reported on March 9th, we find that CFRs are lower in Italy for each age group, but higher overall. This phenomenon can be explained by a stark difference in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we review basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and mortality. As a case study, we then investigate how total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between China and Italy evolve over two months until May 7th 2020.},

abstract = {Besides advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities as major contributors to increased risk of severe disease and fatal outcome from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19), there is now emerging evidence that overweight and obesity predispose to severe symptoms and negative prognosis. Remarkably, the severity of COVID-19 appears to rise with increasing body mass index (BMI). The association between COVID-19 outcomes and overweight/obesity has biological and physiological plausibility. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this strong association include the chronic pro-inflammatory state, the excessive oxidative stress response, and the impaired immunity that is commonly reported in these individuals. The role of cytokines, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and altered natural killer cell polarization in the dangerous liaison between COVID-19 and obesity are discussed here. These pathways can favor and accelerate the deleterious downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, obesity is well known to be associated with reduced lung function and poor response to mechanical ventilation, thus placing these individuals at high risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, obesity may lead to other complications, such as renal failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular damage, which in turn can further accelerate negative clinical outcomes from COVID-19. Obese individuals should be shielded against any potential viral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with consequential considerations for compulsory protection devices and social distancing. Health care providers should be aware that obesity predisposes to severe symptoms and negative prognosis in COVID-19 patients.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this video we're going to look at Bayes' Theorem from mathematics to help us compute the conditional probabilities. COVID-19 tests are actually in two categories, genetic tests and antibody tests, and both of these have different levels of sensitivity and specificity - i.e how accurate they are. While Genetic tests have extremely low false positive rates, some antibody tests do have higher false positive rates and, given the low prevalence in the general population, Bayes' theorem demonstrates how problematic this can actually be. Disclaimer: I'm not a medical doctor or epidemilogist, just a math prof, and so these toy examples are meant to illustrate the ideas of Bayes' theorem, not make actual concrete predictions based on a specific test.},

abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, are a group of viruses that cause infections in the human respiratory tract, which can be characterized clinically from mild to fatal. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible. The global spread of COVID-19 can be described as the worst pandemic in humanity in the last century. To date, COVID-19 has infected more than 3,000,000 people worldwide and killed more than 200,000 people. All age groups can be infected from the virus, but more serious symptoms that can possibly result in death are observed in older people and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Novel data report more severe symptoms and even a negative prognosis for the obese patients. A growing body of evidence connects obesity with COVID-19 and a number of mechanisms from immune system activity attenuation to chronic inflammation are implicated. Lipid peroxidation creates reactive lipid aldehydes which in a patient with metabolic disorder and COVID-19 will affect its prognosis. Finally, pregnancy-associated obesity needs to be studied further in connection to COVID-19 as this infection could pose high risk both to pregnant women and the fetus.},

The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities. Methods: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI < 25 kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25–34 kg/m2: 17.2%, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2: 34.8%, p = 0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m2, OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45–9.83; p = 0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25–5.98; p = 0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13–2.63; p = 0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation. Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the potential association of obesity and other chronic diseases with severe outcomes, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographic data, past medical history, and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. Results: From February 17 to April 5, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19. Among them, 44 patients (42.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 29 (65.9%) required IMV. The prevalence of obesity was 47.5% (49 of 103). In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.13-25.64). Moreover, patients who required IMV were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI = 30-34.9 kg/m2; aOR: 6.85, 95% CI: 1.05-44.82), or severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2; aOR: 9.99, 95% CI: 1.39-71.69). Conclusions: In our analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission, whereas history of heart disease and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were independently associated with the use of IMV. Increased vigilance and aggressive treatment of patients with obesity and COVID-19 are warranted.},

abstract = {Suppose you test positive or negative for SARS-Cov-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. What are the chances you actually have the disease? In this video we're going to look at Bayes' Theorem from mathematics to help us compute the conditional probabilities. COVID-19 tests are actually in two categories, genetic tests and antibody tests, and both of these have different levels of sensitivity and specificity - i.e how accurate they are. While Genetic tests have extremely low false positive rates, some antibody tests do have higher false positive rates and, given the low prevalence in the general population, Bayes' theorem demonstrates how problematic this can actually be. Disclaimer: I'm not a medical doctor or epidemilogist, just a math prof, and so these toy examples are meant to illustrate the ideas of Bayes' theorem, not make actual concrete predictions based on a specific test.},

abstract = {Aim: There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. Method: Simulations are performed to assess the likelihood that a published result is false. Results: In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Discussion: For many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. Conclusion: In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},
