My name is Edward F. Hillenaar and I am the founder and CEO of Total Health Foundation. Through a journey in different directions, I now walk a path in which my knowledge and life experiences are used for therapy and counseling to improve the 'quality of life'.

As a serious athlete, I've always experienced the positive effects of sport and exercise and fitness on my physical and mental well-being. Running is my passion and in 2012,  I participated in an ultra-marathon race of 236 km ("The Ancient Khmer Path ') in Cambodia. The intensity of such an endeavor in a Buddhist country like Cambodia has been an unforgettable experience for me. I have learned a lot about myself and my consciousness in exceptional circumstances.

My regular 'scientific' education consists respectively of the Academy of Physical Education and Physiotherapy in The Hague (HALO); Sports and Exercise Science at the University of Utrecht ("Sports, Exercise and Health"); and Clinical-Health Psychology. Combined with my interest in Eastern Buddhist psychology and philosophy, all my knowledge and experience can be used for my mission within the Total Health Foundation.

My research interests include psychology, philosophy and data science of the origin and nature of human consciousness.
